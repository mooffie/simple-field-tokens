This module, for Drupal 7, exposes fields as tokens.

E.g., a "field_expiration" field will be exposed as [node:field_expiration].

This is a temporary, and very limited solution till this feature is implemented
by either CCK or Token. This module doesn't try to be very useful.

Alternatives:

- Wolfgang Ziegler's Entity module.
